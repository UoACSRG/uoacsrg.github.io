  "body": "### Welcome!\r\nWe are a group of PhD students (and academic staff) in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](http://www.ece.auckland.ac.nz/en.html) at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. We have a broad variety of research interests, ranging from computer architecture to formal methods to security. However, everything we do is applied to embedded systems - computers with dedicated functions within a larger mechanical or electrical system, characterised by constrained computing resources and real-time computing requirements.\r\n\r\nWe are also all heavily involved in Teaching Assistant work, in particular for design courses, including Introduction to Computer Organisation, Digital Systems Design, Microcomputers and Embedded Systems, Software Design, Advanced Digital Design, and Advanced Embedded Systems. Between us, we are involved in at least four start-up companies too.\r\n\r\n### Group Members\r\nNathan Allen - Bioelectronics Modelling \r\n\r\nnall426@aucklanduni.ac.nz\r\n\r\nAndrew Chen - Embedded Vision \r\n\r\nandrew.chen@auckland.ac.nz\r\n\r\nRyan Kurte - Wireless Sensor Networks \r\n\r\nrkur014@aucklanduni.ac.nz\r\n\r\nHammond Pearce - Timing Predictability and Modelling \r\n\r\nhpea485@aucklanduni.ac.nz\r\n\r\nZac Roberts - Sensor Network Virtualisation \r\n\r\nzrob005@aucklanduni.ac.nz\r\n\r\nBenjamin Tan - Hardware Security \r\n\r\nptan262@aucklanduni.ac.nz\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\nAllen, N., Andalam, S., Roop, P., Malik, A., Trew, M., & Patel, N.
